This repository stores a project made for practicing `Godot 4.3`'s Control nodes.

The intention was to reproduce the UI of the game [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening_DX) using the nodes provided by Godot with any additional funcionality added as needed.

The final result is available at the following [link](https://nadjiel.github.io/links-awakening-ui-clone/).

## Disclaimers
All the assets used of resources like music, SFX, sprites and fonts are from the original [Nintendo](https://www.nintendo.com/) game. This project was created for educational purposes only.
